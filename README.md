# Simulated-Racing

“Simulated Motorsport Race” is an AI controlled race where the AI both controls the car and the decisions that go along with the strategy. This means that certain choices like, when to change tyres, when to use more fuel, etc, are all chosen by the AI to try to achieve the best result. There are similar software like around a "Motorsport manager" approach where the AI only controls the driving while the user controls the strategy however this is not like that where the AI should control everything. This should mean that the AI will perform calculations on how much time it loses or gains based on certain actions. Furthermore, a user interface would be implemented so the user can see the race and results as they can watch the race almost like they are watching a real life race. In the end as an extension, there is room to implement a selection choice for the user where they can pick certain parts of the car and then see how it performs in the race based on their choices, for example, different engines where one may be better around a certain track. This should create a software where users can observe AI making real-time decisions and observe the differences that are made in real-life choices in motorsport races
